# Students-Grades-Manager
1. Asks the user to enter the number of students and the number of subjects. 

2. Asks for the input of the coefficients of the subjects. The coefficient must be between 1 and 5. 

3. Asks for the input of the grades. The grade must be between 0 and 20. 

4. Calculates the average of the grades for each student, taking into account the coefficients. 

5. Calculates the class average and calculates the percentage of students who have an average higher than the class average. 

Remark: For instructions 2 and 3, the program must take into account the conditions on the

coefficients and the grades, respectively. If the input data does not meet the condition, the program must repeat the request.
